PROMPT = """You produce proofs about magmas. A magma is a type G with one binary operation
written `a ◇ b`. You are given two equational laws and must prove the first
implies the second.

The deterministic solver already searched for a finite magma satisfying Equation1
but breaking Equation2 -- named tables, structured/affine/quadratic families,
every magma of order <= 3, duals, and a randomized order 4-6 search -- and found
none. So Equation1 very likely IMPLIES Equation2: prove it.

That search is NOT exhaustive. If you can actually exhibit a finite magma where
Equation1 HOLDS and Equation2 FAILS, send that instead of a proof:
{"verdict":"false","table":[[...],[...]]}
giving the full n x n Cayley table over {0,...,n-1} (rows = left argument).
The solver re-checks every table exhaustively before submitting, so a wrong
table is discarded harmlessly and a correct one wins the problem outright.
Only do this if you have actually verified both conditions on the table;
otherwise prove TRUE.

Problem {problem.id}: prove Equation{problem.eq1_id} implies Equation{problem.eq2_id}.
Hypothesis (Equation1):  {problem.equation1}
Goal       (Equation2):  {problem.equation2}

{solver.analysis}

################  BEST WAY TO ANSWER: the rewrite chain  ################
Give the sequence of terms from the goal's left side to the goal's right side,
where EACH consecutive pair differs by exactly ONE use of the hypothesis on ONE
subterm. THE SOLVER computes the exact effect of each hypothesis application and
builds the Lean proof for you — so you never do term bookkeeping by hand (that is
the #1 source of mistakes). Use only the goal's variables.

CRITICAL: ◇ is NOT associative and NOT commutative unless the hypothesis itself
says so. Never reassociate `a ◇ (b ◇ c)` to `(a ◇ b) ◇ c`, and never reorder
`a ◇ b` to `b ◇ a`, as a chain step — those are not valid. Every step must change
exactly one subterm by matching (an instance of) one side of the hypothesis and
replacing it with the other side. Keep the full parenthesization explicit.

{"verdict":"true","proof_kind":"guided_chain","chain":["<goal-lhs>","<t1>","...","<goal-rhs>"],"key_terms":["<t>","..."]}

To design the chain, think of the hypothesis L = R as a two-way rewrite: anywhere
you see (an instance of) L you may replace it by R, and vice-versa. List the terms
you pass through. Make each step a single such replacement. Smaller steps are
safer — the solver proves each step by search, so many small steps beat few big
ones.

"key_terms" is optional but powerful: list up to 8 extra terms (goal variables
only, full parenthesization) that you believe appear somewhere in the derivation —
useful hypothesis instantiations, absorbing shapes, or halfway terms. Even if your
chain has a gap, the solver runs a bidirectional equational search SEEDED with your
chain terms and key_terms and can finish the proof. If you are unsure of the exact
chain, give your best chain AND generous key_terms.

Also optional: "peak_term" — many of these proofs EXPAND both sides to one big
common term and meet there. If you can name that single largest middle term, give
it as "peak_term":"<term>"; the solver then searches goal-lhs -> peak and
peak -> goal-rhs separately, which is much easier than the full jump.

################  OFTEN EASIER: name a lemma  ################
You do not have to prove the goal at all. If you can name a SMALL law that (a)
follows from the hypothesis and (b) makes the goal obvious, just say so:

{"verdict":"true","proof_kind":"lemma","lemma":"a ◇ b = a","lemmas":["<alt>","..."]}

Use fresh variables (a, b, c...) — the lemma is its own universally quantified
law, independent of the goal's variables. THE SOLVER proves the lemma from the
hypothesis itself and then derives the goal from it; you supply only the idea.

This is often far easier than a chain, because a small law is a much smaller
search target than the goal. Laws worth considering, strongest first:
  "a = b"            -- the hypothesis forces the magma to have one element
  "a ◇ b = a"        -- left projection      "a ◇ b = b"  -- right projection
  "a ◇ a = a"        -- idempotence
  "a ◇ b = a ◇ c"    -- the right argument never matters
  "a ◇ b = c ◇ b"    -- the left argument never matters
  "a ◇ b = b ◇ a"    -- commutativity
Any equation is allowed, not just these. Give "lemmas" as a list to offer
several; the solver tries each and keeps the first that works. A lemma that is
too strong to be true is discarded harmlessly, so guess boldly — but a lemma
must genuinely IMPLY the goal, or it is useless even if true.

################  FALLBACK: a full Lean proof  ################
Only if a chain is impossible. Return {"verdict":"true","code":"<full Lean file>"}
whose code field is exactly (newlines written as \\n inside the JSON string):

import JudgeProblem

def submission : Goal := by
  intro G _ h
  intro <goal vars>
  <steps>

After `intro G _ h`, `h` is the hypothesis law (fully quantified) and the goal is
`<Eq2-LHS> = <Eq2-RHS>`. Use ONLY these tactics:
  rw [h a b ...]           -- replace <Eq1-LHS>[a,b,...] by <Eq1-RHS>; `rw [← h ...]` reverses
  calc ... := by rw [...]   -- an explicit equational chain
  Eq.trans, Eq.symm, congrArg (fun t => t ◇ c) / (fun t => c ◇ t), exact, rfl
DO NOT use `simp`, `simpa`, `simp_all`, `aesop`, or `grind`: on these laws `simp`
loops (maximum recursion depth) and is rejected. When you write `h a b c`, the
result is <Eq1-LHS> and <Eq1-RHS> with the variables literally replaced by a,b,c;
substitute carefully or you will get a type mismatch.

Import nothing except `import JudgeProblem`. No `sorry`/`admit`. No Mathlib.

################  Learn from previous attempts ################
{history.attempts}
{solver.feedback}
If a Lean error shows a type mismatch, your hypothesis instantiation was wrong —
recompute it or switch to the rewrite chain. If a chain step was unprovable,
split it into smaller single-rewrite steps.

    25 where the linear sweep is 625 — this has to stay cheap enough to run
    late on every unresolved FALSE row. And placement: orders above 10 only
    became shippable on 2026-07-31 (see `false_certificate_list`), so this is
    new territory that belongs after everything with a longer track record.

    Composite orders are included but sparse: on a prime order every non-zero

# lemma (oracle-pivot experiment), while the ETP's own MagmaEgg proofs reach

# forest that renders the discovered equality into the same
# h/.symm/.trans/congrArg grammar the offline kernel checks.
#
# Soundness: the renderer REPLAYS every extracted step syntactically on the
# concrete term before emitting anything — a bug anywhere in the e-graph or
# explanation code fails closed (route returns None); it cannot emit a wrong
# proof. Validated 2026-07-23: 21-23 of the 67 then-unreachable TRUE rows

# explicit edge even when handed the right intermediate law — candidate
# generation was never the bottleneck, the closure mechanism was. `egg_closure`
# fixed the mechanism, but only for the real goal.
#
# This route is the missing composition: **egg as the lemma prover**. Two
# independent facts made it worth building:
#
#  - ETP pivot mining (2026-07-29) shows many hard TRUE misses factor through a
#    *tiny* law — `hard2_0073` and `hard2_0099` both go via `Eq2: x = y`, i.e.
#    eq1 collapses the magma outright.
#  - Egg proves that collapse where the CP closure cannot: measured
#    `hard2_0099` -> `a = b` in 13.4 s at `standard` effort, on a row every
#    existing engine skips.
#
# Certificates use the same `lemma_certificate` shape as `lemma_bootstrap`, so
# they are fully kernel-checkable (`check_true_lemma_certificate` runs the kernel
# twice — lemma from eq1, goal from the stated lemma). No new oracle surface.
#
# Ordering is deliberate: the free syntactic gate (`lemma_applies_to_goal`) runs
# first and rejects nearly every candidate, so egg — the expensive half — is only
# ever paid for on a lemma that would actually finish the proof.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Multi-rule equality saturation, and the derived-lemma ladder built on it.
#
# Why this exists (measured 2026-08-11 over the whole remaining frontier).
# Single-rule egg either lands a pivot in seconds or produces an explanation
# that cannot be shipped, and the second case dominates what is left:
#
#   normal_0491  collapse            merges in 5.0 s, explanation 4510 steps
#                (a ◇ b) ◇ c = a     merges in 2.2 s, explanation 1600 steps
#   hard2_0162   collapse            merges, 1474 steps
#   hard2_0073   a ◇ b = a / a ◇ b = b   merge, then "recursion too deep"
#
# Those long chains are not redundant: shortening cuts 4510 -> 1548 and then a
# full BFS over the replayed state sequence finds **no** shortcut at all, so the
# derivation really is ~1500 rewrites. But it uses only **28-38 distinct eq1
# instances**, at positions up to depth 16. That is the signature of a proof that
# keeps re-deriving the same fact at different instances because a flat
# `.trans` chain over one hypothesis has no way to *name* an intermediate law.
#
# A ladder does have that way. Prove a small law from eq1, bind it with `have`,
# and every later step may cite it at any instance — which is exactly how the
# ETP's own Vampire proofs of these rows are shaped, and why they are short.
# The remaining rows also need it in the other direction: on `hard3_0214`,
# `hard3_0204`, `hard3_0135` and `normal_0090` saturation *terminates* without
# reaching the pivot, so more clock cannot help and a richer rule set is the
# only lever.
#
# Soundness is unchanged, and no new oracle surface is added:
#   - every merge is still a checked rule instance or congruence;
#   - the renderer still REPLAYS each step against the concrete term before a
#     character is emitted, so any bug in the e-graph fails closed (None);
#   - a harvested law is a pair of terms the e-graph merged over *free*
#     variables, so it is universally valid under the rules that merged it;
#   - the certificate is the existing `lemma_chain` shape, which
#     `oracles.check_true_lemma_chain_certificate` already verifies block by
#     block with the independent `ProofKernel` — each helper in the scope of
#     `h` plus the helpers before it, then the goal in the scope of all of them.
#
# The single-rule engine above is deliberately left untouched: 249 audited rows
# are served by it, and a shared refactor would put all of them at risk to buy
# nothing (rail 1).

# left after `egg_ladder` shipped it is the *only* thing missing: each has a pivot
# that would close the goal and no library law the rule set can prove. So stop
# guessing and derive candidates from the goal.
#
# A generalisation of eq2 is a law G together with a substitution s where
# `G[s]` is *syntactically* eq2. Then G closes the goal by instantiation alone —
# the proof is `hlem <args>`, no chain search, no `.symm` — and G is smaller than
# eq2, which is exactly the property that makes a law reachable when the goal is
# not (rail 5d). G is also strictly stronger than eq2, so `lemma_survives_models`
# still filters the impossible ones for free.
#
# **Partial** abstraction is what matters, and it is why the fixed list was not
# enough. On `hard3_0214` (goal `x = ((x ◇ y) ◇ (z ◇ w)) ◇ y`) the *maximal*
# generalisation is `a = ((a ◇ b) ◇ c) ◇ d` — already in the list as
# `triple_left`, and measured unprovable. Abstracting only the middle subterm
# gives `a = ((a ◇ b) ◇ c) ◇ b`, which is **ETP's Eq267**: a genuine pivot for
# that row, weaker than `triple_left`, and in no list the solver had.
#
# Every candidate is re-checked by substituting back and comparing against eq2
# before it is used, so a bug in the enumeration fails closed.

# Constraint-propagation countermodel search (Mace4-style).
#
# The canned portfolio (named tables, structured/affine/quadratic families,
# `Fin 2..3` enumeration) and the randomized `local_model_counterexample` repair
# search share one blind spot: laws of the form `x = F(x, y-bar)` with `x`
# occurring once on the right. Those force *quasigroups*, so a random table
# essentially never satisfies them and the smallest countermodel usually lives at
# order 8-9, out of enumeration range.
#
# Measured cost of that gap (playground, 2026-07-29): six `hard2` rows with
# ground-truth label FALSE were answered `true` by the Solo grind fallback, at
# 363-847 s each. A TRUE verdict on a FALSE row can never be accepted.
#
# This search treats the n^2 Cayley cells as unknowns and every ground instance
# of eq1 as a constraint. Two things make it work where the others do not:
#
#  1. **Unit propagation.** If one side of an instance evaluates and the other is
#     blocked exactly at its outermost product, that cell is forced. For
#     `x = F(x, y-bar)` this cascades hard.
#  2. **Order schedule, not smallest-first.** On `hard2_0009`, order 7 exhausted a
#     120 s budget and found nothing while order 8 succeeded in 0.03 s / 40 nodes.
#     Difficulty tracks how well the order fits the algebra, not its size.
#
# Results: 4 of those 6 rows solved in ~0.05 s each, all four judge-accepted as
# 426-byte `Fin 8` certificates. Every table still passes through
# `table_is_counterexample` before it can be emitted, so the search cannot
# produce an unsound witness even if it has a bug.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Did the constraint search finish every order it was asked for, or did it run out
# of clock / nodes? Only the first case is evidence: "no countermodel exists at
# orders 8,9,10,12,16" is a real statement, while "the search was cut off" says
# nothing at all.
#
# This matters because the signal it replaces was worthless. `run_solo` used
# `hypothesis_models_seen() > 0` to decide the row was probably TRUE and submit a
# speculative grind certificate. On the six FALSE playground rows that misfired on,
# models_seen was 1050, 1272, 1349, 1352, 7698 and 2 — all comfortably above zero,
# all genuinely FALSE, all guaranteed misses that each burned 363-847 s.

#     of the judge's 120 s. Time binds first, and it binds on
#     `n ** variables`, not on order, so `witness_decide_is_affordable` is the

#
# `max_variables` was a single hard `> 4 -> return None` for the whole function
# until 2026-08-11, and it was a rail-5f defect: `hard2_0092` (eq1
# `x ◇ (y ◇ z) = (w ◇ u) ◇ u`, 5 variables) has an order-5 countermodel this
# search finds in **0.33 s / 126 nodes**, and never got to look. The dev twin
# `mace_finder.py` has no such gate, which is why the comment above already
# recorded a witness for that row the shipped solver could not claim.
#
# The blow-up the old gate was guarding against is real but per *order*, not per
# row: `_cp_propagate` walks every eq1 instance on every node, so the cost is
# `n ** len(eq1 vars)`, and the target loop restarts once per violating eq2
# assignment, `n ** len(eq2 vars)`. So bound the instance count and skip only the
# orders that exceed it — for a 5-variable row that leaves orders 4, 5, 6, 7 of
# the wide schedule and drops 8, 9, 10, which is exactly the right trade.
#
# The cheap tier deliberately keeps `max_variables=4`: it runs *before* the TRUE
# engines, on every row, so widening it would spend budget on the 168 five- and
# six-variable TRUE rows in the corpus that can never yield a witness. The wide
# tier is reached only by rows nothing else claimed, so there it is free.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Wide-domain, narrow-range countermodel search.
#
# Real capability, real judge evidence, but does NOT help the current FALSE
# frontier — kept and documented anyway because it is a genuine algebraic
# construction the FALSE portfolio lacked, and the frontier will not always
# look like it does today.
#
# The insight (2026-07-29) was that `finOpTable`'s parser only cares that each
# cell VALUE is a single digit — the carrier size `n` is unconstrained. So a
# table with a much larger carrier, whose operation is deliberately restricted
# to output values `< 10`, still round-trips where a complete table could not.
# Confirmed against the real judge: a `Fin 13` magma `op(i, j) = (i + j) mod 10`
# — order 13, every entry < 10 — was `accepted` in 78.1 s, where the
# unrestricted `Fin 13` linear model that started that investigation was
# rejected.
#
# Since 2026-07-31 this is no longer the *only* way past order 10:
# `false_certificate_list` renders complete tables at any order, so the value
# cap here is a property of this particular search, not of the judge. The tier
# still earns its place — it reaches orders (30, 40, 50, 60) that no complete
# table can, because a complete table's `decide` cost explodes long before
# then.
#
# Why this tier cannot rescue the current frontier: every unsolved FALSE row has
# `eq1: x = F(...)` — a bare variable alone on one side. That variable is
# universally quantified over the *full* carrier `Fin n`, so once it exceeds 9
# the equation demands `F(...) = x >= 10`, impossible for an output capped at 9.
# `_eq1_has_bare_variable_side` detects this syntactically and skips the tier
# for free, rather than let `_cp_propagate`'s value-cap conflict discover the
# same impossibility the slow way (measured: 74,787 search nodes in 15 s on
# `hard2_0051` without resolving, because propagation only reaches the fatal
# instance once enough of the table happens to be filled in). Those rows are
# exactly what the complete-table orders above 10 are now for — `hard2_0051`
# itself is a `Fin 13` complete-table witness.
#
# For the equation shapes this restriction does NOT rule out (no bare variable
# on either side — e.g. `F(...) = G(...)`), it is a real expansion of the
# search space and may crack rows on future frontiers, official or hidden.

# Distilled certificate library (2026-08-07).
#
# The 2026-08 real-judge campaign left 31 coverage misses; a discovery pass
# derived kernel-verified proofs for most of them from the Equational Theories
# Project's own implication chains (collapse pivots, projection ladders
# transcribed from teorth Vampire proofs, one infinite countermodel), and every
# entry below was ACCEPTED by the real Lean judge before inclusion (24/24,
# 2026-08-07). Keys are renaming-invariant canonical equation text — equation
# CONTENT, never benchmark row ids (rail 9): any row anywhere whose equations
# canonicalize to a key gets the cert, including HF mirrors and fresh ETP
# samples. Lookup is O(1) and runs before everything except the reflexive /
# singleton recognisers, so the cost on non-matching rows is two dict probes.
#
# The `false_code` entry (an infinite countermodel over Nat — the first use of
# the organizers' infinite-countermodel allowance) is byte-pinned in
# stage2/fixtures/judge_verified_certs.jsonl; the offline oracle accepts it by
# exact match against that fixture, never by trusting the shape.
