Marathon few-shot solver — in-run lemma cache + few-shot transfer.

This demo showcases the single most marathon-distinctive strategy: a solver
that builds its own proof library from problems it has already solved
during the same run, then injects the k most-relevant prior wins into the
prompt for each subsequent LLM call. Solo cannot do this — every Solo
problem starts a fresh subprocess with no memory of prior successes.

Strategy:

  Pass A (free, brute force):
    Counterexample search on Fin 2..3 for every problem. ~40-50% of
    'normal' problems get a 'false' certificate here at zero token cost.

  Pass B (LLM with growing few-shot pool):
    Walk the remaining (likely true) problems in difficulty order. For
    each, look up the top-k most structurally similar prior wins from
    the in-memory cache, prepend them as worked examples to the prompt,
    and ask the LLM for a tactic body. Every accepted-shaped 'true'
    answer is appended to the cache so later problems benefit.

Why few-shot helps in marathon (and not Solo):
  * Solo reset → each problem's prompt starts empty.
  * Marathon → the solver carries an evolving library of proofs that
    actually worked on this very run's problem set. Style, naming, and
    common patterns transfer for free.

Cache durability: both in-memory (used for prompt building) and
appended to ``<scratch>/proof_lib.jsonl`` for offline analysis. The
scratch dir is wiped at run start by the runner, so the cache is
fresh per run — no cross-run state.

Known limitation (and a forking opportunity): the few-shot pool is
populated as soon as the solver *submits* an answer, not when the
judge accepts it. Judging happens after the solver exits, so any
proof the LLM hallucinated and submitted could enter the pool and
poison later prompts.

Two mitigations are wired in here:

  * Cheap *syntactic* prefilter on by default (banned placeholders,
    balanced delimiters, non-empty body). It costs ~µs per candidate
    and catches the most common LLM hallucinations. Set
    ``FEWSHOT_VERIFY_BEFORE_CACHE=0`` to disable for A/B comparison.
    It is a prefilter, NOT a real Lean check.
  * Full Lean validation (``lake env lean`` on a per-candidate
    JudgeProblem-equivalent module) is the stricter fork — see the
    ``_prefilter_proof`` docstring for the trade-off and pointer.

Submission behaviour is unchanged: every accepted-shape proof still
goes to the answer file. The flag only gates whether the proof is
allowed to seed the few-shot pool for *later* prompts.

Token discipline:
  * marathon_llm.call_llm self-polices and refuses past-budget calls.
  * Solver pre-checks budget_remaining() before each call; stops
    when projected next-call cost would exceed remaining budget.
