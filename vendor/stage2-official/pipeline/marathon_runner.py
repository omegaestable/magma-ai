"""
Marathon-mode runner: launches a solver subprocess with a *global* budget
spanning N problems, instead of one subprocess per problem.

This is a separate entry point from ``pipeline/runner.py`` (Solo). The
Solo path is unchanged.

Solver contract (env vars; absent → solver runs in Solo stdin/stdout mode
and this module is irrelevant):

    JUDGE_MARATHON_MANIFEST       /abs/problems.jsonl     read-only manifest
    JUDGE_MARATHON_OUTPUT         /abs/answers.jsonl      append-only JSONL
    JUDGE_MARATHON_BUDGET_SECONDS 30000                   global wall-clock
    JUDGE_MARATHON_BUDGET_TOKENS  3276800                 global LLM tokens
    JUDGE_MARATHON_SCRATCH_DIR    /abs/scratch            wiped each run

Output JSONL line format (last-write-wins per id):

    {"id": "normal_0042", "verdict": "true", "code": "<full Lean source>"}

The runner enforces only the wall-clock budget. Token budget enforcement
lives in ``pipeline/marathon_proxy.py`` (PR2). The runner SIGTERMs the
solver process group at the deadline and SIGKILLs 5 s later; output JSONL
is frozen at SIGTERM time (late writes that hit disk after SIGTERM are
ignored at scoring).

This file does no Lean work. Scoring lives in ``pipeline/marathon_score.py``.
