"""
Marathon-mode local LLM proxy.

The proxy interposes between the solver subprocess and the real upstream
(OpenRouter / OpenAI / DeepSeek). It exists to give marathon mode the same
defensive posture Solo gets from ``pipeline/proxy.py``:

  * The real upstream API key is never exposed to the solver — the proxy
    holds it, the solver only sees a localhost base URL plus a per-run
    shared secret.
  * Token budget is enforced at the network layer. Even a solver that
    bypasses ``marathon_llm.call_llm`` and uses the OpenAI SDK directly
    has to go through this proxy (because that is the only LLM endpoint
    reachable from the solver's env), so the meter cannot be bypassed.

The proxy speaks an OpenAI-compatible subset:

  POST /v1/chat/completions   — forwarded upstream, ``usage`` is parsed
                                and added to the running token total.

It binds to 127.0.0.1 only and authenticates callers via a shared secret
generated per run (``Authorization: Bearer <secret>``). The secret is
delivered to the solver as ``OPENAI_API_KEY``; any local process without
the secret is rejected.

Token accounting is held in memory under a lock and is the sole authority
for the running total — the runner watchdog reads it via
``proxy_handle.tokens_used()`` (in-process call, no file I/O). The proxy
also writes a telemetry file ``<state_dir>/tokens_used.txt`` for offline
debugging, but ``state_dir`` is a runner-private directory NOT exposed to
the solver subprocess. A solver that writes to its own
``<scratch>/tokens_used.txt`` cannot influence the counter the runner
watchdog or budget pre-check consults.
