# Mathematics Distillation Challenge - Equational Theories (Stage 2)

*(Damek Davis, Terence Tao)*

## Overview

This competition explores a core question in AI for mathematics: can strong mathematical reasoning be distilled into a compact, human-readable artifact that improves LLM performance on formal tasks?

This competition is organized by:

Damek Davis (Associate Professor, Department of Statistics and Data Science, University of Pennsylvania)

Terence Tao (Fields Medalist, Professor at UCLA, Co-Founder of SAIR Foundation)

and SAIR Foundation.

The setup is inspired by Honda, Murakami, and Zhang (2025), *[Distilling Many-Shot In-Context Learning into a Cheat Sheet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20820)*.
Our difference is that the distilled artifact is discovered through an open competition process rather than a single model query.

## Background

The pilot task is equational implication over magmas: given Equation 1 and Equation 2, determine whether Equation 1 implies Equation 2.

This challenge is based on the [Equational Theories Project](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/):

- Raw implication graph: [export_raw_implications](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/)
- Law list (4694 laws): [equations.txt](https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/data/equations.txt)

Example: `E_4: x = x * y` implies `E_3: x = x * x`.

## Core Task

Stage 2 raises the bar from Stage 1. Instead of only predicting true/false, participants must **prove** their answers:

- If the implication is **true**: a Lean 4 proof that the hypothesis implies the goal.
- If the implication is **false**: a Lean 4 proof certificate (a finite magma witness where the hypothesis holds but the goal fails).

Both directions require machine-verifiable certificates. A deterministic Lean judge accepts or rejects each answer — no partial credit, no probabilistic scoring.

## What Participants Submit

Participants submit a **solver**: a single `solver.py` file, **≤ 500 KB**, that follows the I/O protocol of the chosen track.

The solver can combine:

- **Deterministic strategies** (brute-force counterexample search, pattern matching, symbolic proof construction)
- **LLM calls** (via the organizer-provided proxy)
- **Judge calls** (submit candidate proofs for Lean verification, receive accept/reject feedback)

## Tracks

Stage 2 has two tracks. Both share the same judge, the same five-status verdict mapping, and the same single-file `solver.py` contract (≤ 500 KB). They differ only in I/O shape and budgeting:

- **Solo** — one problem per solver subprocess, fixed per-problem budget, stdin/stdout JSON protocol.
- **Marathon** — N problems per solver subprocess (reference N=100), one shared global budget = `compression_ratio × N × Solo per-problem` (default `compression_ratio = 0.5`), file-based manifest in / append-only JSONL out.

One source file can support both tracks. Concrete I/O, size limits, budgets, scoring, and the evaluation model are documented in **[evaluation.md](evaluation.md)**.

## Key Dates

- Stage 2 pre-registration opens: **April 23, 2026**
- Stage 2 officially starts: **May 1, 2026, 12:00 UTC**
- Stage 2 submission deadline: **August 31, 2026, 23:59 AoE**

## Official Repository

The official GitHub repository for Stage 2 contains the evaluation pipeline, demo solvers, a step-by-step tutorial, and local testing support:

- [https://github.com/SAIRcompetition/equational-theories-lean-stage2](https://github.com/SAIRcompetition/equational-theories-lean-stage2)

For setup instructions and the recommended local testing workflow, see **[evaluation.md](evaluation.md)**.

## Publication Policy

- Stage 1 submitted prompts may be made public to support community learning.
- Stage 2 submitted solvers may be made public after evaluation.

## Eligibility and Registration

Stage 2 registration is **open to everyone** — participation is not restricted to Stage 1 participants or top-performing teams. Anyone can register a team and submit a solver before the Stage 2 submission deadline.

## Team Participation and Anti-Cheating Policy

- Each individual or organization can participate in only one team.
- Teams must register members and sponsors in advance.
- If coordinated cheating is detected (including sockpuppet teams), all related teams will be disqualified.

## Community Feedback

Rules, scoring details, and evaluation procedures are still being refined and will be shaped by community input. Community contributions are welcome.
